\section{Conclusion}\label{conclude}
In this paper, we propose a novel convolution bidirectional LSTM-CRF model on Chinese event extraction task. Our model departs from the inherent characteristic of Chinese language, formulates the event detection task as a sequence labeling fashion, and features both bidirectional LSTM and CNN to capture both sentence-level and lexical features from raw text. Experimental results show that without human-designed features and external resources, our neural network method can achieve state-of-the-art performances on ACE 2005 datasets. In the future, we will explore more global evidences, from both discourse level and cross document level,  to further alleviate the language specific issues, such as the zero pronoun phenomenon in Chinese. Currently, many event extraction methods utilize the type consistency between triggers or arguments as a post-processing step or a set of consistency-check features to prune the extraction results, which should be treated jointly in the extraction models, hopefully in a neural network fashion. And, we will also attempt to model the whole event extraction task  in an end-to-end paradigm to further jointly deal with trigger and argument labeling, avoiding feature engineering or other resources.
