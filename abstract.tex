Event extraction  underpins many text mining applications. It is a task of extracting events of
certain types and their corresponding arguments of different roles from unstructured texts such as news articles and tweets.
State-of-the-art event extraction approaches rely on high quality feature extraction that requires careful template design
and is dependent on the results of specific semantic or lexical analyzing tools as well as extra thesauruses.
As a result, current approaches are hard to generalize, and are not portable to new languages, especially those with limited resources or tools.


The unique language structures and syntax of Chinese make  prior work on English event
extraction inapplicable.  In this work, we demonstrate that, for the first time, it is possible to
construct a generalized yet effective Chinese event extraction model without relying on manually designed feature
templates or specific lexical or syntactic tools. Our novel, broadly applicable approach employs a convolution
bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (\CBiLSTM) to automatically learn a set of effective feature
representations. We achieve this by exploiting different neural network components to extract features at various
levels. More specifically, we employ  a convolutional component (\CNN) for prominent lexical features and a
bidirectional long short-term memory component (\BiLSTM) for capturing sentence level representations. To overcome the
language-specific challenge of Chinese word segmentation, we combine a conditional random field (\CRF) layer over a
character-level neural network component to allow us tag each character beyond the word boundary. We evaluate our
approach by applying it to the ACE 2005 dataset. The experimental results show that our approach can deliver
state-of-the-art performance in both trigger and argument labeling, but requires little human involvement.
